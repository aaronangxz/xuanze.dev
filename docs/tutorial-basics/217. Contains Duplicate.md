# 217. Contains Duplicate

## Question 
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
 ```

Constraints:
```
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
```

---

## Approach

1. Create a hash table with `unordered_map` with both key and value as integer. The key will be the element from `nums`, while value will be the number of occurences.
2. Iterate through the `nums` vector, for every element, insert into the table and at the same time increment the count.
3. As long as the count is > 1, it is a duplicate.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        //hash map
       unordered_map<int,int> m;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            //insert into map, in the position of current element
            //increment count
            m[nums[i]]++;
            
            //when the element has more than 1 as value, it is a duplicate
            if(m[nums[i]] > 1) return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```
