## Introduction

So when I was building [this](https://github.com/aaronangxz/duke) school project, I encountered a requirement to write soem data into local files.

Basically, these are so called temporary files or caches, folders are created during runtime.

Sounds straight forward enough, what's the problem here?

## Problem

So the problem is due to our beloved `git`. Apparently git will not push empty directories.

For example:

```
src - main
        - main.java
    - sub
```

For this folder structure, `sub` will not be pushed to git. This shouldn't be an issue, most of the time. But let's find some way to make it push.

## How

Easy, just put somethings inside?!

Actually yes, just put something inside. For me, I just create a nto so meaningful file that doesn't look random

```
.gitkeep
```

So the folder structure will be:
```
src - main
        - main.java
    - sub
        - .gitkeep
```

And the `sub` folder can be pushed to git now.

Some relatively useless knowledge here.. but here you go :)
