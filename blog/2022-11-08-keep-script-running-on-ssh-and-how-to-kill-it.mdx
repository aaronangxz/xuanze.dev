## Introduction

If you want to host some ever-running script, what option do you have?

1. Run on your laptop, and never sleep / off it (??)
2. Get a Raspberry Pi (ugh.. overkill)
2. Pay a few dollars to host it somewhere (few dollars to host somethings so small.. worth?)
3. Ask your friend to run on his/her laptop and never off it.

Option 3 seems to be the best option if you manage to convince.

Fortunately I have the opportunity of abusing my personal VM at work. 
I mean, not abusing, it's somewhat related to work too. I'm sure.

## How

These are roughly the steps I took:

### Clone the repo
Clone the repo into the VM. My path is `~/xuanbot`.

### Start running, but..
We cannot just run it with the usual `go run main.go`, because if we do that, the process will hang up when we exit the ssh conenction.

Instead, we can do

```bash
$ nohup go run main.go &

xuanze.ang@n36-172-051:~/xuanbot$ nohup go run main.go &
[1] 670740
xuanze.ang@n36-172-051:~/xuanbot$ nohup: ignoring input and appending output to 'nohup.out'
```

At this point, the process is running.

### Find the process id
Next, we need to know what is the process id of our task.

```bash
$ ps -ef | grep go

xuanze.ang@n36-172-051:~/xuanbot$ nohup: ignoring input and appending output to 'nohup.out'
ps -ef | grep go
root        1411       1  0 Nov07 ?        00:01:56 /etc/sysop/mongoosev3-agent/mongoosev3-agent
root        3888    1411  0 Nov07 ?        00:00:36 /etc/sysop/mongoosev3-agent/plugin/driver/driver
root        3896    1411  0 Nov07 ?        00:00:07 /etc/sysop/mongoosev3-agent/plugin/journal_watcher/journal_watcher
root        3945    1411  0 Nov07 ?        00:01:02 /etc/sysop/mongoosev3-agent/plugin/collector/collector
root        4016    1411  0 Nov07 ?        00:00:49 /etc/sysop/mongoosev3-agent/plugin/baseline/baseline
xuanze.+  670740  670583  0 11:32 pts/0    00:00:00 go run main.go
xuanze.+  670844  670740 99 11:32 pts/0    00:00:37 /tmp/go-build2256816827/b001/exe/main
xuanze.+  671173  670583  0 11:32 pts/0    00:00:00 grep go
```

We can see that our build is running as pid `670844` for 37 seconds now.

### Kill it
Since we have enough information now, kill it!
```bash
kill 670844
```

Process should now be killed and removed from the list. Done!

## Bonus
Useful command to move a file from local to ssh machine.

`scp <origin file path> <name>@<host>:<destination file path>`


```bash
$ scp /Users/xz/file.txt xuanze.ang@1.1.1.1/home/xuanze.ang
file.txt                           100%   11KB  47.6KB/s   00:00
```
