## Introduction

So in the AffiliateManager project, a lot of endpoints are being cached. And somehow for some reason, the past me decided that a TTL
of 0 is fine. And that left with me with a redis fill with thousands of keys :(

Now, time to purge it!

But I want to keep some of them, like session tokens but will like to clear those that are related to id etc.

So here's how...

<!--truncate-->

## How

Apparently, we can type in a `function` into the redis-cli!

To delete keys that match a pattern:

``` lua
eval "for _,k in ipairs(redis.call('keys','<redis key pattern>')) do redis.call('del',k) end" 0
```

Replace `<redis key pattern>` with the key. For example, if I want to delete all keys that look like `user_id:123`. The command will be:

``` lua
eval "for _,k in ipairs(redis.call('keys','user_id:*')) do redis.call('del',k) end" 0
```

Finally, a clean redis :)
